Office Security Function (Alpha-numeric Code Check):

Explanation: To check if the code entered matches the correct security code, use the == operator to compare the entered code to the correct one.

You have been hired by Github to help them fix their password system. They would like you to create A function that will check how long a password is. Your program should be able to accept a alpha-numeric password and check if the password is more or less than 10 characters long. if the password is longer than 10 characters, your program should tell the user that their password is too long. If the password is under 4 characters the function should tell the user the password is too short. If the password meets the length criteria, there should be a message confirming to the user that their password was created successfully.

Operator: len() (to count) and conditional checks (<, >, ==)
Explanation: You need to check the length of the password and compare it using < > and == operators to the correct feedback.


You have been hired as an engineer to develop a federal income tax function for a tax agency. They would like to be able to take in a user's annual income ammount and check how much money a person will need to pay in taxes based on the amount passed into the function.
Provided are income amounts and how much they will be taxed:

Operator: >=, <=, and basic arithmetic
Explanation: You will need to use the >= and <= operators to check which tax bracket the income falls into and then calculate the tax based on the percentages.

If a user makes between 0.00 and 12000.00 per year, they will be taxed 10%, plus an additional 3% for the state.

A:tax_rate = 0.10 + 0.03  # 10% federal + 3% state
 
If a user makes between 12001.00 and 50000.00 per year, they will be taxed 12%, plus an additional 3% for the state.

A:tax_rate = 0.12 + 0.03  # 12% federal + 3% state

If a user makes between 50001.00 and 103000.00, they will be taxed 22%, plus and additional 3% for the state.
A:tax_rate = 0.22 + 0.03  # 22% federal + 3% state

If a user makes between 103001.00 and 198000.00, they will be taxed 23%, plus and additional 3% for the state.
A:tax_rate = 0.23 + 0.03  # 23% federal + 3% state

Your function should return how much money the person owes in taxes based on the amount of money they provided.

else:  return "Income is too high to cal tax."
