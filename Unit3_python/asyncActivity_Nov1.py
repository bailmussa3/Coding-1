# if i was ask to create a calendar app 
#  Days of the week would be best represented by a list of strings.
# Example: ("monday", "tuesday", "wednesday")
# The date would be represented using a date object.
# Example: 1 (for the 1st day of the month) or using a datetime object.

 # What is the diffence  between the float and integer data types?
 # An integer (int) is a whole number ( 1, -5, 42) without a decimal point.
# A float is a number that includes a decimal point (3.14, -0.001, 100.0).

# Identify the correct data type for each scenaro?
# A comment section on a picture on Instagram: String, since it will be text-based.
comment_section = "Great picture!"

# A survey form asking if a user has ever traveled to another country: Boolean, since it's a yes/no question.
traveled = True  # or False

# Describe the difference between var, let, and const?
# // var is function-scoped or globally-scoped and can be re-declared and updated.
# // let is block-scoped and can be updated but not re-declared in the same block.
# // const is block-scoped and cannot be updated or re-declared after its initial assignment.

# Create three variables that when multiplied together result in 4000:
#// Creating three variables
# let num1 = 10;
# let num2 = 20;
# let num3 = 20;

# Describe a scenario where you would use the let variable and when you would use a const variable in a computer program:

# // Use let when you expect to change the value of a variable during the program's execution.
# // Example: let userAge = 25; userAge = 26;
const shouldShowWelcomeMessage = true; 

# If there were three things you feel could improve the class, what would those things be and why?
# // This answer can be a string.
const improvements = "More coding exercises";
