Every program is a series of funcions  smaller programs of sets of instructions that we can control when  its activated.
There are two varitations of functions: ser-defined functions

# and built-in functions

# Bulit-in functionsz: instructions that have already been written,
# and bulit-in to the prgraming language.

Print('coding class') # pint is a bulit-in function. we ca identity 
# by the round brackets

number =int(input('please type in a number '))

print(3*number)

# all data types, variables., and operators are just pieces for us
# to use in order to write instructions for functions.

# user defined fndtions- custom functions created by an engineer

# how do you write a user defined function?

    #our instructions and stores it for later
